{
	// Place your snippets for plaintext here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "log1",
		"body": [
			"처음: $1",
			"다음: $2",
			"끝나면서: $0",
			"마지막: ${3:label}"
		],
		"description": "설명은 이곳에 쓰면 되!"
	}
}
